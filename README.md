## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM
- A little of Grid

### What I learned

It was my most difficult challenge for me in HTML and CSS.
I learned a lot about the use of flexboxes, the semantics of HTML tags as well as the pseudo elements ::before and ::after.
I also learned to style inputs more easily.

### Useful resources

- [z-index doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) - This helped me for doing the background gradient left and right.
- [pseudo-element ::before and ::after](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/::before) - This helped me for doing the background gradient left and right.
